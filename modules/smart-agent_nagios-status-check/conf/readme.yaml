  There is no SignalFx official integration for `Nagios` but there is still a 
  [monitor](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/telegraf-exec.html) to use.

  ### Monitors

  You have to configure your existing Nagios script into the `telegraf/exec` monitor.
  
  You can configure as many monitors as you have nagios checks to reuse but you have to define for each 
  one at least:

  * the `dataFormat: nagios` in `telegrafParser` parameter to parse status from script exit code.
  * at least one dimension like `script` in `extraDimensions` to identify your check. If you do not 
  define `aggregation_function` and let empty as by default it will work for all dimensions you choose.

  Also it could be useful to adapt the `intervalSeconds` for each script.

  ### Examples

  ```yaml
  - type: telegraf/exec
    intervalSeconds: 180
    command: /usr/local/bin/scripts/check-ipmitool.pl
    extraDimensions:
      script: check_ipmitool
    telegrafParser:
      dataFormat: nagios
  - type: telegraf/exec
    intervalSeconds: 900  
    command: /usr/local/bin/scripts/check-megaraidsas
    extraDimensions:
      script: check_megaraidsas
    telegrafParser:
      dataFormat: nagios
  ```

notes: |
  This module has been designed to alert with the same behavior as 
  [Nagios](https://nagios-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html#AEN78), basically a gauge equal to 1, 2 and 3 
  respectively triggering `WARNING`, `CRITICAL` and `UNKNOWN` alert.

  While SignalFx does not provide `Unknown` severity this module uses the `Major` severity for unknown alerts.

  The metric is named `nagios_state.state`, you need to add an `extraDimensions` to your monitor in order to be 
  able to differantiate multiple script states.
